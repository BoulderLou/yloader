<p style='margin-top:0in'>The symbols can be stored in plain text files. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in'>Symbols can
be separated by white spaces (blanc, tab or end of line) or by comma or
semicolon. Lines starting with # or // are considered comments and ignored.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in'>Here is an
example of a symbols list file contents</p>

<div class="sample">
  msft yhoo; GOOG,<br>
  IBM<br>
  intc<br>
  // this is a comment<br>
  #this is another comment<br>
  <br>
  TXN
</div>

<p style='margin-top:0in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in'>Note -
presently, the symbols cannot contain whitespace characters (blanc, tab, new
line). This will be fixed in a future release when symbols surrounded by quote
characters will be accepted.</p>

<p style='margin-top:0in'>If the symbols file contains duplicate symbols (i.e. 
symbols with the exact same spelling including the case), only the first 
occurrence will be considered and subsequent occurrences will be ignored.</p>
