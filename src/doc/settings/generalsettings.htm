	<li>
	<b>Auto
    start downloading - </b>when checked, downloading will be initiated as soon as
    the application starts. Useful the application is used as part of an 
    automated data downloading system, run from the command line.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Check
    for updates at startup</b> - enables auto checking for new releases at 
	startup</li>
  <li>
    <b>Simultaneous connections - </b>the number of simultaneous connections. 
    Depending on the network bandwidth, choosing multiple connections will 
    usually improve downloading speed.</li>
	<li>
    <b>HTTP Request timeout - </b>the delay in seconds after which a request 
	that hasn't completed is abandoned, or 0 for no timeout (wait indefinitely).</li>
	<li>
    <b>Proxy Server</b><ul>
	<li><b>IP address/name and port number - </b>the IP address or name that 
	identifies the proxy server on the network, and the TCP port number on which 
	this proxy server is listening for connections. The address and port number 
	are separated by &quot;:&quot;. If this field is left blanc, no proxy server will be 
	used. Consult your network administrator or proxy server documentation for 
	the exact configuration. Examples: 127.0.0.1:8118 (this is the local 
	computer, port 8118), ourproxyserver:4444 (a proxy server with the name 
	ourproxyserver listening on port 4444).</li>
	<li><b>User name - </b>enter the user name if the proxy server requires 
	authentication</li>
	<li><b>Password - </b>enter the password if the proxy server requires 
	authentication</li>
	</li>
	<li><b>Open data file with </b>- enter or browse to the application name you 
	want to use when opening data files directly from YLoader. If this field is 
	empty, the default application associated with the extension of the data 
	files will be used. For example, if the extension is csv, Excel will be used 
	(if installed), or if the extension is txt, notepad will be used. To define 
	a custom application, this field should contain the full path of that 
	application, such as &quot;c:\windows\notepad.exe.</li>
	<li><b>Do not reload old data in Update mode - </b>by default, when the 
	Update mode is active, if old data is inconsistent with new data, all the old 
	data will be reloaded. This can happen if there have been splits or 
	dividends between the last available bar locally and the new bars to be 
	downloaded. If however this behavior is not desired, check this box to turn 
	it off. This can be useful if the data has been modified manually and 
	updating it would cancel all manual changes.</li>
