<p>YLoader generates two types of log files: session log file and diagnostic log 
file.</p>
<p>The session log file is optional, and its location, name and type of content 
can be set in the options described below.</p>
<p>The diagnostic log file contains information about the internal functioning 
of the application and its content is updated every time the YLoader is run. Its 
location is fixed and set to &quot;&lt;YLoader installation path&gt;\log\yloader.log&quot;.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
		<li>
		<b>Session Logging</b><ul>
		<li><b>Log file</b> - the path and name of the file that will receive 
    information about the session (see the Log file
    section). If this field is left blanc, no log file will be generated.</li>
		<li><b>Append new log - </b>when checked, each session will append log 
    information at the end of the log file. If not checked, the log file will be 
    overwritten each time.</li>
		<li><b>Log only error events</b> - will only save only error events to the log 
	file</li>
	</ul>

		</li>
		<li><b>Diagnostic logging</b><ul>
		<li><b>Enable diagnostic logging - </b>will save detailed info in 
		the diagnostic log file. This option should normally be disabled to 
		avoid any performance degradation, but it may have to be enabled in case 
		of hard to debug or reproduce bugs. Some limited information is saved 
		into the log file even if this option is off.</li>
	</ul>
