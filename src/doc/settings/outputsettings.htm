<ul>
	<li><b>Data file header</b> - user defined text that will be added to the 
	beginning of each data file. If this box contains any text, a new line 
	character will be automatically inserted between this text and the rest of 
	the file.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Data
    file name transformations</b> - options to configure the data file name 
    generation for symbols<ul>
  <li>
	<b>Prepend/Append </b>: prepends and/or appends the
    specified string to the file name for each symbol. For example, using the
    strings &quot;_&quot; and &quot;test&quot; the file name for the symbol <i>msft</i>
    would be: <i>_msfttest.csv </i>(assuming the extension is chosen to be &quot;csv&quot;)</li>
	<li>
	<b>Extension</b> - the extension for all data files. Can contain a leading 
    &quot;.&quot; or not. The default value is <i>csv</i>.</li>
</ul></li>
  <li>
    <b>Create subdirectories for data files</b> - when this is checked, data will 
	be saved in a hierarchy of directories under the main data files directory. The hierarchy 
	is organized in 2 levels: the first level will be named using the first 
	letter of the symbol, and the second level will contain the second letter of 
	the symbol, or _ if the symbol has only one letter. For example, if the root 
	data directory is c:\data and the symbol is MSFT, the path to the data file 
	will be: c:\data\m\s\msft.csv. Similarly, the path for IBM will be 
	c:\data\i\b\ibm.csv and the path for A will be 
	<a href="file:///c:/data/a/_/a.csv">c:\data\a\_\a.csv</a>.</li>
	<li>
    <b>Auto select output directory - </b>when this option is checked, if the 
	output path edit box on the main page is empty, the data will be saved 
	automatically under the symbols file directory, using the content of the 
	edit box as the root. The default value for the root is &quot;data&quot;, but it can 
	be changed or even removed. If the output specified directory doesn't 
	exist, it will be automatically created</li>
	<li>
    <b>Character mapping - </b>will define up to for character mappings between 
	a character to be replaced (source) and a character to replace with 
	(destination).</li>
</ul>
<h3>About character mappings</h3>
<p>During data downloading, if a symbol contains one or more source characters 
defined in any of the mappings, they will be replace with the corresponding 
destination characters.</p>
<p>This feature is used primarily to allow saving of data 
	for symbols that contain illegal file name characters (\, /, *, &quot;, &lt;, &gt; and 
	|) that otherwise could not be saved.</p>
<p>For example, the data for the symbol TSE:ABX downloaded using the Google 
datasource could not be 
	saved as &quot;TSE:ABX.csv&quot; because of the illegal &quot;:&quot;. However, if one of the mappings is 
	&quot;:&quot; to &quot;_&quot; (which is the only default mapping), then the data for 
that symbol 
	will be saved as &quot;TSE_ABX.csv&quot; which is a valid file name. </p>
<p>It is ok to 
	map a character to no character (just leave the second edit field of the 
	mapping empty) - this will result in the source character being removed completely 
	from the file name of all symbols that contain it. It is also ok to map a 
character to space (blanc).</p>
