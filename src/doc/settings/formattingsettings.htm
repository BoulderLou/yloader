<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Add
    symbol to column</b> - enables/disables adding a
column to each data file containing the symbol name. The column number can be between
0 (leftmost column) and 6 (rightmost column) and should be entered in the
    associated edit box.</li>
	<li>
	<b>Sort bars in ascending order - </b>if on, it will force saving bars sorted from
    the oldest to the most recent. If off, the order will be reversed with the
    most recent bars at the top of the file. In the latter case the <b>Update
    option</b> in the Time range group is also disabled.</li>
	<li><b>Field separator - </b>sets the character or string to be used as 
	field separator. The default value is &quot;,&quot;, but any character (including 
	blanc) or string can be used.</li>
	<li><b>Volume mulitplier - </b>decimal number which is multiplied with the 
	downloaded (and optionally adjusted) volume value to generate the final, 
	saved volume value. For example, to save the volume as thousands of shares, 
	use the multiplier 0.001, which will divide the real volume by 100. To leave 
	the volume unchanged, use the multiplier 1 (the default value).</li>
	<li>
	<b>Date
    format</b> - the date can be written as<ul>
  <li>mm/dd/yyyy - 10/25/2007 </li>
	<li>dd/mm/yyyy - 25/10/2007</li>
	<li>yyyy/mm/dd - 2007/10/25</li>
</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Pad date fields with 0s</b> - when checked, will ensure that month and 
	day fields have exactly 2 characters, even for 1 digit months or days, so 
	Jan 05, 2006 will be written as 01/05/2006</li>
	<li>
	<b>Date separator</b> - sets the character to be used as a date field 
	separator. The default value is &quot;/&quot;. To generate dates without a separator, 
	clear this field. In this case it is usually a good idea to also check the 
	option to Pad the date fields with 0s, or dates may become ambiguous (for 
	example, 1252008 can be interpreted as 12/5/2008 or 1/25/2008, but 01252008 
	is clearly 1/25/2008).</li>
	<li>
	<b>Use regular expression formatting - </b>when checked, it will enable 
	regular expression formatting and disable settings based formatting (such as 
	Add symbol to column, Field separator etc).</li>
	<li>
	<b>Regular expression formatting</b><ul>
  <li><b>Reset to default values - </b>will reset the Match regex and Format 
	string to their initial default values when clicked</li>
	<li><b>Unlock - </b>the regular expression formatting controls are locked by 
	default to avoid accidental changes. Clicking on this button will unlock 
	these controls for editing.</li>
	<li><b>Match regex </b>- contains the regular expression used for extracting 
	strings from the input data</li>
	<li><b>Format string </b>- contains the strings that defines the output data 
	format</li>
</ul></li>
