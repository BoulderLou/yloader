    <b>Symbols file</b>: select the name of the file containing the

    name of the symbols file can be entered by typing it, by selecting it in the
    Symbols List File dialog, by dragging and dropping it from an Explorer

	<li><b>Time Range
    </b>- the range of dates for which to download
the data, either all available data or a specific range. Each time the application starts,
    it will set the start date to hold the same value used in the most recent session, and the
    end date to today's date. It is also possible to set the start date to 
	&quot;None&quot; (empty date) in which case the data will be downloaded starting with 
	the earliest date available.<ul>
		<li><b>All
    available</b> - will download all available data for each symbol</li>
		<li><b>Update
    - </b>when checked, the application will attempt to update the data. When 
		this option is on, if the data file for a symbol already exists, it will 
		add only the new bars, up to the end date or if all is checked, up to 
		the most recent date. If the data file doesn't exist, it will create it 
		and load all the data for the specified time range. This option is 
		automatically turned off if the &quot;Most recent bars last in file&quot; option 
		is off.<br>
		By default, in Update mode, old data (that was already present on the 
		system) is not changed, unless it has become inconsistent with the new 
		data. This can happen if adjustment is turned on and there have been 
		recent splits or dividends. In that case, the adjustment factor is now 
		different for old data than it was at the time it was originally 
		downloaded. To maintain data consistency, YLoader will then reload all 
		data, not just the most recent. There are cases however when this data 
		reloading is undesired, such as when data is manually modified on disk, 
		perhaps to correct bad bars. In that case, this behavior can be disabled 
		by checking the corresponding option in the General Settings dialog, or 
		by using the flag -w from the command line.</li>

    and validation<ul>
		<li><b>Dividend and split adjusted
    </b>- when checked, downloaded data will be adjusted for dividends and 
	splits.</li>
		<li><b>Validate
    prices</b> - when checked will verify that each bar has valid data (high &gt; 
	open, close, high etc). The Options dialog contains extra settings used to 
	fine tune the validation process - see the Options dialog section.</li>

       <b>Single data file</b>:

        single data file name. The file name can also be entered by typing it
        directly into the associated edit box, by dragging and dropping from an
        Explorer window, or from the command line (see the Command Line section). Also, a list of most
        recently used eight output files is available by clicking on the side arrow
        down button. If this field is left empty, the single data file will not be generated.

	<li><b>The download progress bar - </b>shows graphically the downloading 
	progress. This bar will 
	be displayed even after the session has ended, and it will show the status 
	at the end of the most recent session (incomplete if the session was canceled, or full 
	if the session was successfully completed)</li>
	<li><b>Downloaded symbols info </b>- detailed info about the downloaded status 
    of all symbols. Indicates whether the
download was successful or not, the symbol, and a message showing how much data has
been loaded, for a successful operation, or a diagnostic message in case of a 
	warning or
error.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Opening data files directly from YLoader</b></p>
<p>To open a symbol data file directly from YLoader, double click the symbol 
name in the symbols list, or the line containing that symbol in the download 
status list. By default, the application associated with the file extension is 
used to open the data file. For example, if the extension is txt, notepad will 
be used, or for csv, Excel will be used (if installed on the system). It is 
possible to use any application to open data files - go to Setting/General 
Settings and enter the full path of the application to run.</p>

<b>Note about symbols</b><ul>
  <li>
    The list of symbols will ignore duplicate symbols. Symbols are considered duplicates if they have the exact same 
    spelling, regardless of the case, so <b> <i>msft</i></b> and <i><b>MSFT</b> </i>are 
	considered duplicates.</li>
</ul>

<b>Notes about using the Update option</b>:

<ul>
  <li>

if a change in the previously loaded data has occurred between the time of the 
last download and the current download, then all data is reloaded. This can 
happen if for example there has been an adjustment (split or dividend) between 
the previous and current update, in which case all the data for that symbol will 
be changed to reflect the adjustment. This behavior can be disabled if desired, 
by checking the option &quot;Do not reload old data in Update mode&quot; on the General 
Settings page in the Settings dialog.</li>
  <li>

the various options (data and file format, adjustment etc) must be consistent 
between updates.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Notes about using the output file option</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>If an output file is specified, it will be created by copying the 
	content of all the data files that were generated during the downloading 
	session to this file. If this file already exists, it will be replaced with 
	the new content. </li>
	<li>The data files for individual symbols are not deleted after this 
	operation.</li>
	<li>The order in which the data files are copied to the output file is not 
	guaranteed, unless only one connection is used to download data. </li>
	<li>Only data for symbols that were successfully downloaded is copied to the 
	output file.</li>
	<li>All available data for those symbols is copied, regardless of whether 
	the downloading was done in update mode or not.</li>
	<li>The output file tends to get very large, so opening it with Notepad 
	after a downloading session can be a lengthy operation as Notepad loads the 
	entire file in memory.</li>
</ul>
