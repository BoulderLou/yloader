By default the application will check the website for updates at startup. This automatic check can be turned off in the Options dialog. Please note that this check doesn't send out any information - it only reads an xml file on the web site that contains the information about the most recent released version. If the version on the website is more recent than the installed one, the user will be notified and can then choose to download and install the update or not
