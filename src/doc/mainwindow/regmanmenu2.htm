<ul>
<li><b>Enter Registration Key -</b> will open the YLoader "Enter Key" dialog</li>

<li><b>Hardware Change Log -</b> will open the "Save hardware change history" dialog. This file is sometimes useful to diagnose
	changes in the local hardware fingerprint</li>

<li><b>Unregister -</b> will unregister the current validation key from the computer. This command is useful when the user wants to move the YLoader to a new computer. After the key has been unregistered, a confirmation code is shown. Email this code to yloader.com for confirmation. Use this command carefully - once the key has been unregistered, it cannot be used again. </li>
</ul>
